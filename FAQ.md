# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How can I go-live with this integration?**  
A: _Reach out to account team for process integration._

**Q: Why not just rely on a general web search engine (e.g., Google search)?**  
A: _General web search cannot access licensed SAP Notes and only indexes the limited public content portions of SAP Knowledge Base Articles (KBAs), not the full, frequently updated authoritative content (including implementation details or attachments).__

General web search therefore misses restricted material, version nuance, contextual information, and structured metadata that the Cloud ALM self-service APIs use to tailor relevance to your specific problem._
